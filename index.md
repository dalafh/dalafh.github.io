# About me
I was born and raised in Montreal. I fell in love with programming in high school where I learned the basics of website designing. I then decided to pursue my studies in that field by applying for CEGEP in computer science and mathematics. I have now completed my Bachelor degree in software engineering in the spring of 2021 and am currently pursuing my Masters in artificial intelligence at MILA. I am fluent in both English and French.
