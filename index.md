I was born and raised in Montreal. I fell in love with programming in high school where I learned the basics of website designing. I then decided to pursue my studies in that field by applying for CEGEP in computer science and mathematics. I have now completed my Bachelor degree in software engineering in the spring of 2021 and am currently pursuing my Masters in artificial intelligence at MILA. I am fluent in both English and French

# Other interests
Music has always been a part of my life. I have learnt the basics of various instruments (violin, percussions, piano) and am currently focusing on guitar. I have done a lot of songwriting in high school. I also love to solve puzzles and enigmas. Finally, I love writing short (and longer) stories.
